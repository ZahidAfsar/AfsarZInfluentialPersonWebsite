// Influential Person Website
// This is where you do a multipage site using Vanilla JS and Tailwind, on a person that has been influential to you. 
The site itself needs to be able to do the following.
Responsive
Multiple pages - At least 4
1 page must be why it's influential to you.
Must be well designed
// I used styles but it was inline and only for colors since I couldnt find ways to add custom colors to tailwind

// Peer Comment: The style and design of this website is very clean. However, when you view the website in desktop mode (1920x1080) or (1440x1080), all of the text looks like it is slightly to the left. Mobile version looks clean and I see no problem. Another small thing is that you should update the title tag in your index html. Other than that, everything functions properly. Good job!
